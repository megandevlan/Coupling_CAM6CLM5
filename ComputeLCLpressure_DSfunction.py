# Author: Meg D. Fowler 
# Date:   14 Sept 2020

# Inputs: 
#     filesIn --> path to .nc file containing surface information: 
#                Surface pressure (Pa)
#                Surface temperature (typically at reference height, 2m) (K)
#                Surface relative humidity (typically at reference height, 2m) (%)
#                NOTE: If 'filesIn' is an array of strings (paths), data is concatenated 
#                      along time dimension. 
#     PSname --> Name of surface pressure as saved in file
#     TSname --> Name of surface temperature as saved in file 
#     RHname --> Name of RH as saved in file 
#     fileOutName --> file name to save P_lcl into 
# Outputs: 
#     filePath --> Pressure level (in mb) of LCL above the surface
